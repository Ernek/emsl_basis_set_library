! The atomic natural orbital basis sets of Almlof, Taylor and coworkers are
! based on atomic valence SD-CI densities or densities derived from state-
! averaged MR SD-CI calculations.  The aim was to derive generally contracted
! sets with large numbers of Gaussian primitives without significant loss in
! the SCF or correlation energy. Choices of what mixture of s,p,d,f,g
! functions to group together were based on the natural orbital occupation
! numbers.

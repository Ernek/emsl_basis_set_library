! The Dunning-Hay split valence basis sets are moderate-sized segmented
! contractions, which can be used efficiently in programs that don't support
! general contractions.  The single shell of Rydberg functions is designed to
! describe the n = 3 states of first row atoms and n=4 states of the next row.
! For Ne and Ar (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the
! values were estimated on the basis of neighboring elements.

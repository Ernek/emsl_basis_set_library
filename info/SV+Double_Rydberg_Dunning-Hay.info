! The Dunning-Hay split valence basis sets are moderate sized segmented
! contractions, which can be used efficiently in programs that don't support
! general contractions.  The single shell of Rydberg functions is designed to
! describe the n = 3 and n = 4 states of first row atoms.
! For Ne (where exponents were not given by Dunning & Hay) the
! values were estimated on the basis of neighboring elements.

! The Hay-Wadt (n+1) effective core potentials include an extra shell of
! electrons beyond what is traditionally available in effective core potentials.
! For example, on potassium the 3s and 3p electrons are not subsumed into the
! core as they would be in other ECP's.  This set is derived from the exponents
! and contraction coefficients given in the Hay-Wadt paper and were obtained
! directly from P. J. Hay.  Any discrepancy between the numbers contained in
! these basis sets and the JCP paper are attributable to the file obtained from
! Jeff at Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The elements beyond Kr include the
! 1-electron Darwin and mass-velocity relativistic corrections in their
! definitions.

!
!! More information
! Diffuse function for the cc-pV6Z and cc-pV(6+d)Z
! 
! auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
! 
! with second-order methods
! 
! using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
! 
! as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
! 
! The full aug-cc-pV6Z-RI and aug-cc-pV(6+d)Z-RI
! 
! auxiliary basis sets are obtained by augmenting the valence
! 
! auxiliary basis sets with these diffuse functions.

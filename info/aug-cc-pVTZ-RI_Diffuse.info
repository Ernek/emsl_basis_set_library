!! More information
! 
! Diffuse function for the cc-pVTZ, cc-pV(T+d)Z, or cc-pwCVTZ
! 
! auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
! 
! with second-order methods
! 
! using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
! 
! as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
! 
! The full aug-cc-pVTZ-RI, aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z-RI, and aug-cc-pwCVTZ-RI
! 
! auxiliary basis sets are obtained by augmenting the (core+)valence
! 
! auxiliary basis sets with these diffuse functions.

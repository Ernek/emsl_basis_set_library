!! More information
! tight functions for te cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVTZ
! 
! auxiliary basis sets for correlated calculations
! 
! with second-order methods
! 
! using the resolution-of-the-identity approximation
! 
! as e.g. RI-MP2, RI-CC2, RI-CIS(D), RI-ADC(2), etc.
! 
! The full cc-pwCVTZ-RI and aug-cc-pwCVTZ-RI auxiliary 
! 
! basis sets are obtained by augmenting the valence auxiliary
! 
! basis sets with these tight functions

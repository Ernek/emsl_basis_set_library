!! More information
! 
! Sadlej&apos;s electric polarization method of Gaussian basis functions was applied to the double-zeta effective core potential basis sets of Stevens, Basch, Krauss, Jasien and Cundari to generate a new augmented polarized valence double-zeta set, 
! 
! named as pSBKJC, which is appropriate for the calculation of dynamic polarizabilities and Raman intensities. 
! 
! The pSBKJC basis set was developed for the atoms of families 14 to 17 
! 
! (from C to F, Si to Cl, Ge to Br and Sn to I).
!

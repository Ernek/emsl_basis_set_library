! These exponents were optimized at the SCF level for the negative ion.
! For H, Li and Be (where exponents were not given by Dunning and Hay)
! the exponents were obtained by simply extending the exponents to smaller
! values, assuming an even-tempered progression.  The Ne exponent, which was
! not given by Dunning and Hay, was estimated on the basis of neighboring
! elements.

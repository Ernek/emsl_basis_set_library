# EMSL basis set library mirror

This repository is a mirror of the
[EMSL basis set library collection](https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal)
for quantum chemistry electronic structure calculations. The webpage
interface is nice to use, but sometimes the website has issues, hence
this repository. It is also nice having text files to work with rather
than an interface that requires a lot of mouse-clicking.

For now, only a reduced set of the basis sets at the EMSL are provided
as Gaussian gbs files. These can be added to your Gaussian
calculations directly, without having to delete the atoms that are not
in your molecule. More basis sets will be added, as well as scripts or
programs to convert to other formats, etc. as I need them.

All credit goes to Dr. David Feller and the many contributors to the
EMSL basis set exchange. When publishing results obtained from use of
the Basis Set Exchange (BSE) software and the EMSL Basis Set Library,
